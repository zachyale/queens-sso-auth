## Introduction
queens-sso-auth is a sample authentication client for the Queen's Single Sign-On service, built with C# and .NET in Visual Studio. This approach was developed by me on the side, during a CMPE-320 project where I wanted to integrate a Queen's authentication system into an application my team and I were developing.


## Demo
You can test a fully working demo of this authentication client by downloading the project, and building it for release. The demo demonstrates the login process, and storage of the user's Net ID upon successful login.


## Built with
